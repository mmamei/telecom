We use data from ${region} region from ${startdate} to ${enddate} . We considered only users generating at least ${above} CDRs in the time interval, and selected a sample of ${limit} individuals.
For each user we mapped his/her ${kop} location in the area of the ${rm} map. The result is a density map associating for each area the number of users (among the ${limit} ones) with ${kop} 
location in there. Figure \ref{${img}} shows density representation for ${kop} location in ${region}.
