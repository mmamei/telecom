To evaluate our results we collected groundtruth data from the statistics web sites of the two cities under analysis.
In particular, we gathered reports for Venice from {\it www.turismovenezia.it}, and for Florence from {\it www.provincia.fi.it}.
Figure \ref{fig:official-1} and Figure \ref{fig:official-2} illustrate the main data we collected. Figure \ref{fig:official-1} shows monthly trend in the number of Italian and foreign tourists in the two cities in 2013. It is possible to see that the number of foreign tourists strongly outweighes Italian ones especially during the summer (we also obtained data for March 2014 in Florence. Compared to March 2013, Florence got -8\% foreign tourists and +11\% Italian tourists. These fluctuations however to dot change the main trend and analysis presented). Figure \ref{fig:official-2} shows the distribution of tourists according to their nationality (these are aggregate data for the whole year). These graphs confirm that foreign tourists outweighes Italian ones: Italians are about  20\% of the tourists. 50\% of the tourists form from one of these countries: US, FR, UK, DE, AU, CN, ES, JP, BR, RU. There is a long tail of tourists from other countries (about 30\%).
These data are acquired from hotels and other accommodations, so it make sense to compare this number of our tourist class (i.e., we do not compare with excursionists as they do not stay overnight).
